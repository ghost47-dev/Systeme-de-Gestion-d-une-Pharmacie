## Todo (anyone is welcome to add/remove items from this list, this is all speculative):
  - [ ] Make mvp without any graphics or database integration (__make sure to use hashmaps for stuff that'll eventually become persistent!__).
    - [x] Figure out what the project structure will look like.
    - [x] The user shouldn't have to specify the id when creating anything (the whateverManager should figure out the id when adding whatever).
    - [x] Track risky quantity products.
    - [x] Add ability to view sale history.
    - [ ] Implement all the damn commands.
      - [ ] The god damn admin stuff is still undone.
    - [ ] Exceptions on quantity related stuff in product and handling them idk where.
    - [ ] Thrannitah micho s8ayyer el mvp. :cry:
  - [ ] Integrate the database with recieved insight from previous step.
    - [ ] Create a new class that abstracts over the requests (in other words remove ArrayList).
    - [ ] Implement it into the code for persistent data ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ]).
  - [ ] The graphics (hopefully won't be hard, we need to finish other stuff asap to make sure we have ample time for this).
    - [ ] We need more steps here.
  - [ ] profit.
